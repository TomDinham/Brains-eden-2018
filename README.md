Glitch is a two player wave defence game, that puts the two players against 5 waves of various enemy with different objects, either attacking you or your base. The aim of the game is to survive every wave that is set to you, if the base dies, you fail. During each round one or many glitches can cause different effects to the game from, stopping a player from moving too giving you free power-ups.
